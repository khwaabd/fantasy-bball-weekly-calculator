For my fantasy bbal team heres how to run this

install python3

to run a single week

    python3 main.py <week number> <year number>

week number is in the fantasy app, year number is the year the season started on so 2022 for 22'-23' season

To run multiple weeks, and output a summary of winners (only works in shell, no cmd for windows, get powershell or a mac/linux u noob)

    ./multi-week-runner <start week> <end week> <year>
